<p>A cartoon is a type of visual art that is typically drawn, frequently animated, in an unrealistic or semi-realistic style. The specific meaning has evolved over time, but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. 
<mark>Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a cartoonist,and in the second sense they are usually called an animator</mark>.
The concept originated in the Middle Ages, and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as a painting, fresco, tapestry, or stained glass window. In the 19th century, beginning in Punch magazine in 1843, cartoon came to refer – ironically at first – to humorous artworks in magazines and newspapers. Then it also was used for political cartoons and comic strips. 
When the medium developed, in the early 20th century, it began to refer to animated films which resembled print cartoons.<br>
<h1><b>Scientific:</b></h2>
Cartoons such as <u>xkcd</u> have also found their place in the world of <tt>science, mathematics, and technology</tt>. For example, the cartoon Wonderlab looked at daily life in the chemistry lab. In the U.S., one well-known cartoonist for these fields is Sidney Harris. Many of Gary Larson's cartoons have a scientific flavor.
