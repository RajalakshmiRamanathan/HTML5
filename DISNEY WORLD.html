 The Walt Disney World Resort, also called Walt Disney World or Disney World, is an entertainment resort complex in Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, Florida, United States, near the cities of Orlando and Kissimmee. 
Opened on October 1, 1971, the resort is operated by Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, a division of The Walt Disney Company. The property covers nearly 25,000 acres (39 sq mi; 101 km2), of which half has been used.
The resort comprises four theme parks (Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom), two water parks (Disney's Blizzard Beach and Disney's Typhoon Lagoon), 31 themed resort hotels, nine non-Disney hotels, several golf courses, a camping resort, and other entertainment venues, including the outdoor shopping center Disney Springs. On October 1, 2021, Walt Disney World started its celebration of its 50-year anniversary which will last for 18 consecutive months ending on March 31, 2023.
In 2018, Walt Disney World was the most visited vacation resort in the world, with an average annual attendance of more than 58 million.The resort is the flagship destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise and has become a popular staple in American culture. In 2020, Walt Disney World was chosen to host the NBA Bubble for play of the 2019â€“20 season of the National Basketball Association (NBA) to resume at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex.
Walt Disney World is also covered by an FAA prohibited airspace zone that restricts all airspace activities without approval from the federal government of the United States, including usage of drones; this level of protection is otherwise only offered to American critical infrastructure (like the Pantex nuclear weapons plant), military bases, the Washington, DC Metropolitan Area Special Flight Rules Area, official presidential travels, and Camp David.
On April 22, 2022, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law which would officially strip the Walt Disney Company of its longtime self-governing status in the area around Walt Disney World by June 2023. The repeal of Disney's special status was widely seen as retaliation against the company for its opposition to Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act, known as the "Don't Say Gay" bill by critics.
